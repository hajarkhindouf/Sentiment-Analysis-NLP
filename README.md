##  Project Overview

This repository presents a streamlined approach to sentiment analysis, utilizing machine learning techniques to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. It's designed for clarity, efficiency, and adaptability.

##  Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare textual data for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Implement machine learning algorithms to learn from data.
- **Model Serialization**: Save trained models for future use.
- **Interactive Interface**: Deploy a user-friendly interface for real-time sentiment prediction.

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdilShamim8/Sentiment-analysis.git
   cd Sentiment-analysis
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can use `pip` to install them:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   Navigate to the `WebSite` directory and launch the app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

##  How It Works

* **Data Processing**: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information.
* **Model Training**: Machine learning models are trained on the processed data to learn patterns associated with different sentiments.
* **Prediction**: The trained model predicts the sentiment of new, unseen text inputs.
* **User Interface**: A Streamlit-based web app allows users to input text and receive sentiment predictions in real-time.


##  Technologies Used

* **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and model implementation.
* **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
* **Streamlit**: Framework for building interactive web applications.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment for exploratory data analysis and model development.
